# FRAME3D
The first folder contains the input files and the current "frame3d" version executable for the 1982 Canoga Park 18-story building that is in many of our papers (see references below)  The folder includes the input files for the takatori record (for090, for091, for092), the building input file for005 and a spreadsheet version of the same (*.ods) for easy editing, and the comprehensive output file for006.  This run is using the current version of frame3d.  FRAME3D runs need to be executed on a linux machine.  Please see the FRAME3D user-guide:  https://authors.library.caltech.edu/26567/

The second folder contains the input files for the three buildings in our ShakeOut work (see reference below).  These input files (the for005 files) are suitable for the previous version of FRAME3D.  Subtle corrections need to be made to update the input files to make them work with the current version of FRAME3D that is included in the first folder.
